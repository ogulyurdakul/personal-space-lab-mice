# Intrusion of Personal Space as a Cause for Violence: An Inverse Reinforcement Learning Problem on Laboratory Mice- Supplementary Material

These are the supplementary material to my COGS566 Probabilistic Models of the Mind project. Supplementary Material A is a `.ipynb` file, which is the Google Colab notebook I use and a `.md` document, which is the WebPPL notebook. The Google Colab notebook contains the necessary code snippets that download, processes and exports the data in JSON format. The JSON file is not absolutely necessary, as the WebPPL notebook already contains it as a string. Supplementary Material B is the WebPPL notebook containing the model, it prints out the results in an array format to be analysed back in Colab for the non-approximated case. The models with the approximated distributions are left as they are, without multiple inference sessions.
